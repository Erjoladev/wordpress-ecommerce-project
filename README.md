This project involves the creation of a WordPress-based e-commerce website named wpprojet. It features a modern design using the Envo eCommerce theme and integrates the WooCommerce plugin for managing products and sales. The site includes a horizontal top menu for navigation, a right sidebar with widgets like Recent Posts and a calendar, and custom visuals with a header and background image.

The shop section showcases at least four products organized into two categories, while a static Contact Me page highlights the project's passion and includes a fictitious email. The footer contains a Facebook logo and a link to a Facebook page. The blog features two posts and additional user roles (Contributor and Editor). Advanced functionalities include message truncation to 35 characters, with further enhancements in progress.
